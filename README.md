Hi, I am a young gal living in the big city of Palo Alto. Everything here is all about yoga and coding and boujee foods which makes me feel weird inside. If I was not a student here I would have to be a millionaire to live in Palo Alto. It is funny because everyone nets millions in annually income but yet everyone bikes around. Either that or they drive Telsas. Very environmentally friendly.
